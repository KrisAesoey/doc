# Maskinporten Client

!!! warning "Status: Opt-In Open Beta"
    This feature is currently only available in the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](../../clusters/gcp.md) clusters.

## Abstract

[Maskinporten](https://difi.github.io/felleslosninger/maskinporten_auth_server-to-server-oauth2.html) allows API providers (in this case, external agencies) to define access policies to their APIs, modeled using scopes based on the organization number of the consumer.

Maskinporten is a service that offers a simple API security model based on the OAuth2 protocol with the use of JWT bearer grants, a concept inspired by [Google's System Accounts](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account).

The NAIS platform provides support for simple declarative provisioning of a Maskinporten client that your application may use to integrate with Maskinporten.

The client allows your application to leverage Maskinporten for authentication and authorization when performing service-to-service requests to external agencies. To achieve this, your application must implement [JWT grants](https://difi.github.io/felleslosninger/maskinporten_protocol_token.html).

## Configuration

### Getting Started

=== "Minimal nais.yaml example"
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: "nais.io/v1alpha1"
    kind: "Application"
    metadata:
       name: nais-testapp
       namespace: aura
       labels:
           team: aura
    spec:
      image: navikt/nais-testapp:66.0.0
      maskinporten:
        enabled: true
        scopes:
          - name: "nav:some/scope"
    ```

### Spec

See the [NAIS manifest](../../nais-application/nais.yaml/reference.md#specmaskinporten).

### Access Policies

The following [outbound external hosts](../../nais-application/access-policy.md#external-services) are automatically added when enabling this feature:

- `ver2.maskinporten.no` in development
- `maskinporten.no` in production

You do not need to specify these explicitly.

### Scopes

Maskinporten allows API providers to define access to their APIs, modeled as scopes and based on the consumer's organization number.

When a client requests a token from Maskinporten:

- Maskinporten validates the validity of the JWT and its signature ([Runtime JWK Secret](#runtime-variables-and-credentials) used to sign the JWT).
- When client has access to the requested list of `scopes`, an `access_token` will be returned to the client and which can be used for authentication to the intended external service.

!!! danger
    Make sure that the relevant service providers have pre-registered **NAV** as a valid consumer of any scopes that you define. Provisioning of client will fail otherwise.
    NAVÂ´s `pre-registered` scopes can be found with proper access rights in [Digdir selvbetjening](https://selvbetjening-samarbeid-ver2.difi.no/auth/login).

## Usage

### Runtime Variables and Credentials

The following environment variables and files (under the directory `/var/run/secrets/nais.io/maskinporten`) are available at runtime:

=== "Description"
    | Name | Description |
    |---|---|
    | `MASKINPORTEN_CLIENT_ID` | Maskinporten client ID. Unique ID for the application in Maskinporten |
    | `MASKINPORTEN_CLIENT_JWK` | Private JWK containing the private RSA key for creating signed JWTs when using the [JWT grants](https://difi.github.io/felleslosninger/maskinporten_protocol_token.html). |
    | `MASKINPORTEN_SCOPES` |  The scopes registered for the client at Maskinporten as a whitepace-separated string. See [JWT grants](https://difi.github.io/felleslosninger/maskinporten_protocol_token.html) for more information. |
    | `MASKINPORTEN_WELL_KNOWN_URL` | The well-known URL for the OIDC metadata discovery document for Maskinporten. |
=== "Example values"
    | Name | Values |
    |---|---|
    | `MASKINPORTEN_CLIENT_ID` | `e89006c5-7193-4ca3-8e26-d0990d9d981f` |
    | `MASKINPORTEN_SCOPES` | `nav:first/scope nav:another/scope` |
    | `MASKINPORTEN_WELL_KNOWN_URL` | `https://ver2.maskinporten.no/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` |
=== "Example value for MASKINPORTEN_CLIENT_JWK"
    ```javascript
    {
    "use": "sig",
    "kty": "RSA",
    "kid": "jXDxKRE6a4jogcc4HgkDq3uVgQ0",
    "alg": "RS256",
    "n": "xQ3chFsz...",
    "e": "AQAB",
    "d": "C0BVXQFQ...",
    "p": "9TGEF_Vk...",
    "q": "zb0yTkgqO...",
    "dp": "7YcKcCtJ...",
    "dq": "sXxLHp9A...",
    "qi": "QCW5VQjO..."
    }
    ```

### Consume an API

Refer to the [documentation at DigDir](https://docs.digdir.no/maskinporten_guide_apikonsument.html).

You may skip any step involving client registration as this is automatically handled when [enabling this feature](#getting-started).

## Legacy

This section only applies if you have an existing client registered at the [IaC repository](https://github.com/navikt/nav-maskinporten)  

### Migration guide to keep existing Maskinporten client (NAIS application only)

The following describes the steps needed to migrate a client registered in [IaC repository](https://github.com/navikt/nav-maskinporten).

#### Step 1 - Update your client description in the IaC repository

- Ensure the **`description`** of the client registered in the `IaC` repository follows the naming scheme:

```text
<cluster>:<metadata.namespace>:<metadata.name>
```

#### Step 3 - Deploy your NAIS application with Maskinporten provisioning enabled

- See [getting started](#getting-started).

#### Step 4 - Delete your application from the IaC repository

- Verify that everything works after the migration
- Delete the application from the [IaC repository](https://github.com/navikt/nav-maskinporten) in order to maintain a single source of truth.
